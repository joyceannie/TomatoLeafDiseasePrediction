# Tomato Leaf Disease Classification

The objective of the project is to classify the images of tomato plant leaves to identify whether the plant is healthy or not. A classification model is trained using Tensorflow and Keras. The application runs locally on Flask server.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images of 5 different classes organised into 5 different folders.
* Tomato_Bacterial_spot

* Tomato_healthy
* Tomato_Late_blight
